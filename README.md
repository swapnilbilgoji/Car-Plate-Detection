# Car Plate Detection

This repository contains a project focused on detecting car license plates using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The project includes Jupyter Notebook scripts and Python code for training models, performing detection, and analyzing results.

## Features

- Detect car license plates from images or video.
- Preprocessing of input data for improved detection accuracy.
- Implementation of machine learning models for plate detection.
- Visualization of detection results.

## Results

### Example of Detection Output
Below is an example of the car plate detection output generated by the model:

- **Jupyter Notebook (73.6%)**
- **Python (26.4%)**

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see [Installation](#installation))

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swapnilbilgoji/Car-Plate-Detection.git
   cd Car-Plate-Detection

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary tools for working with Jupyter Notebooks, such as `jupyter` or `jupyter-lab`.

## Usage

### Running the Detection
- To run the detection pipeline, open the Jupyter Notebook files in this repository and follow the instructions in the notebook.
- Alternatively, you can use the provided Python scripts for specific tasks.

### Example
To detect license plates in an image:
1. Place the input image in the `data/` folder.
2. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python detect_plate.py --image data/car.jpg
   ```
